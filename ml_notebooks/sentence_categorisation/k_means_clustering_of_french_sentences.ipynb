However, it would be nice if the user had the option to filter down the sentences they see to certain categories. For example, if they would like to practice vocabulary specific to the home, or sports. Instead of manually categorising what will eventually be thousands of sentences, I need to create a ml model to automatically place new sentences into a category as accurately as possible.\n","\n","There are a few supervised methods I could use such as naive bayes, support vector machines as well as deep learning models. However, I'll probably get the best results by using google's pre-trained BERT model as a base to encode the sentences and training a few fully-connected layers at the end for my custom classifyer. Computational cost is not so much of a concern as I'll only be running the classifier once on the dataset to generate a category column for the database. Although BERT was originally trained on an english corpus, there's another model called Multilingual BERT that has been trained on Wikipedia in 104 different languages, which would be well-suited to this application.\n","\n","However, I found it pretty hard to find a labeled ground-truth dataset for sentence-level subject classification, especially for foreign languages. I could create one myself but making an unbiased labelled dataset with enough samples in each category would be pretty difficult and probably not worth the time investment in this case, so in the end I've decided to use an unsupervised approach and infer categories. I need to pick between clustering and topic modelling.\n","\n","For this application, I want the sentences to be clustered by topic and not something else like sentiment. Representing the sentences using a bag-of-words model would group sentences together based on the words they contain, which would be more likely to result in topic-based clusters. Better yet, I could use TF-IDF, which, like bag-of-words, assigns a score based on the number of times a word appears in the document but is counterbalanced by the number of sentences in which it is present. Words like ‘this’, ’are’, that are commonly present in all the sentences are not given a very high rank. However, a word that is present too many times in a few of the sentences will be given a higher rank as it might be indicative of its context.\n","\n","Once I have fit the k-means model I can use it to predict which category new sentences belong to."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'seaborn'","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[1;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[1;32mc:\\Users\\Toby Usher\\Documents\\dev\\quivo-app\\ml_notebooks\\sentence_categorisation\\k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb Cell 3\u001b[0m line \u001b[0;36m7\n\u001b[0;32m      <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/c%3A/Users/Toby%20Usher/Documents/dev/quivo-app/ml_notebooks/sentence_categorisation/k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb#W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=4'>5</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mpandas\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mas\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mpd\u001b[39;00m \n\u001b[0;32m      <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/c%3A/Users/Toby%20Usher/Documents/dev/quivo-app/ml_notebooks/sentence_categorisation/k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb#W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=5'>6</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mmatplotlib\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mpyplot\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mas\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mplt\u001b[39;00m\n\u001b[1;32m----> <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/c%3A/Users/Toby%20Usher/Documents/dev/quivo-app/ml_notebooks/sentence_categorisation/k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb#W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=6'>7</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mseaborn\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mas\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39msns\u001b[39;00m\n\u001b[0;32m      <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/c%3A/Users/Toby%20Usher/Documents/dev/quivo-app/ml_notebooks/sentence_categorisation/k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb#W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=7'>8</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39m#from sklearn.feature_extraction import text\u001b[39;00m\n\u001b[0;32m      <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/c%3A/Users/Toby%20Usher/Documents/dev/quivo-app/ml_notebooks/sentence_categorisation/k_means_clustering_of_french_sentences.ipynb#W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=8'>9</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39msklearn\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mfeature_extraction\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mtext\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m TfidfVectorizer\n","\u001b[1;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'seaborn'"]}],"source":["import os\n","import re\n","import math\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","#from sklearn.feature_extraction import text\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer\n","from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\n","%matplotlib inline\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#filepath = os.path.join(\"./fra_mixed_2009_1M\", \"fra_mixed_2009_1M-sentences.txt\")\n","\n","# Train on cleaned dataset of around 850,000 french sentences, capped to 200 characters max\n","filepath = os.path.join(\"..\", \"french_sentences.csv\")\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv(filepath, delimiter='\\t', header=None)\n","df.columns = [\"id\", \"sentence\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Cleaning the data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ff887c6d-0470-4f62-860b-9457b223bb8c","_uuid":"eb590852f097f66ea53be9a970789430fc3f6a63"},"source":["Delete any potential duplicates"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Let's see if there are any duplicates in the dataset\n","df[df[\"sentence\"].duplicated(keep=False)].sort_values(\"sentence\").head(8)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Remove all duplicates from the dataframe\n","df = df.drop_duplicates(\"sentence\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f1bb8d35-27aa-4ff4-9a39-4329517aa6a4","_uuid":"f022fdf6441499ed52b34c063240f4f28b2ff3a5"},"source":["# NLP "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# First we need to get a list of stop words in french.
